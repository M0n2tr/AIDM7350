        <h1>“We wanted to make it easy on ourselves and opened at random times.”</h1>
        <p> "We hope customers will experience this process slowly. Instead of getting photos quickly, if that's the case, why not just use a digital phone to take photos?" the boss said.This unique shop possesses two exceptional features that add an artistic and mysterious touch. Firstly, its opening hours are uncertain, and the latest business hours are updated daily on Instagram. This element of uncertainty creates anticipation and a sense of mystery for customers, while also fostering interaction and engagement. Secondly, even when the shop is not open, customers can still deposit their film rolls for development in the mailbox located at the shop's entrance. The owner personally handles these film rolls and meticulously develops them. This arrangement not only meets customers' needs but also showcases the owner's care and attentive service. This distinctive approach provides convenience and a special experience for customers, further strengthening the trust and connection between the shop and its clientele.</p>

      <h1>“I can't imagine that cultural inheritance is actually happening to me.”</h1>
      <p>During the interview, the owner told me why he chose this career.In the store, there is a sign that reads "Ming Zhu Photography Studio," a long-closed old photo lab that reveals the backstory behind the owner's choice of profession. "This couple is really good to me, and also taught me a lot of skills. I also imagine that they like the industry that they like most." The owner said.Ming Zhu Studio was the place where the owner's journey in photography began. “I still remember when I used to walk through the city centre after school, even if I didn't go in to develop my film, sometimes I would stroll into Ming Zhu's shop and peer into the glass display cabinet to see what cameras they had or pay my respects at the entrance.”“Ming Zhu Digital Photography Lab. When news of their retirement broke, many residents of Tuen Mun came online to share their memories. Despite its humble appearance, I asked them to let me preserve their sign. I thought that since this place held meaning for so many of our neighbours, even if they decided not to continue operating, we should preserve some traces of its existence. To carry on this legacy of dedication and professionalism.”</p>

      <h1>“If you take a picture with your phone, it's fast and cheap. But every time you press the shutter in the film camera, it becomes cautious and conscientious.”</h1>

        <img src="images\顾客照片.jpg" alt="News Image">
    </a>
      <p>Even though the photo quality of smartphones and digital cameras is already quite impressive, most of the customers who come here are young people. Cheery, a female college student, is a loyal customer of this store. She came today to develop film and bought another film camera."If I take photos with my phone, it's quick and cheap, which makes me more casual with each shutter press." Film rolls for film cameras can be quite expensive, so every time you use it to take photos, the photographer needs to be cautious to avoid wasting film. This way, every time you see the final developed photos, it carries the memory of that moment, rather than just being one of the thousands of photos in your phone's gallery.</p>

    <p>The store owner said that he will hold some teaching activities on the use of film cameras and some salon activities for photography enthusiasts in the future. Let more people like this culture.</p>
